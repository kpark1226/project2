## Graph 1: New York - Square Footage of Retail Food Stores
![Retail Food Store](food.png)
This is a histogram representing the number of retail food stores and their corresponding square footage in New York. I only included stores that had a square footage between 25,000 ft^2 and 200,000 ft^2 because those are the most prevalent for retail food stores. I received this data from Data.Gov, which you can find [here](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/retail-food-stores)
